## Hi There! ðŸ‘‹

Hi, I'm Amanda Barbosa from Brazil, graduated in Business Administration who is passionate about data analysis.

I am currently transitioning into the data area and looking for my first job opportunity.

I've used Excel throughout my career, and in recent years, while working at the hospital, I became familiar with Power BI.
During this period, I started studying data analysis and decided to focus my career in this area.
At the hospital, I had the opportunity to perform my first data analysis and build dashboards. Demonstrating how data-oriented management results in more effective decision-making.

I've previously worked in the healthcare area, the technological field, and the pharmaceutical industry.
